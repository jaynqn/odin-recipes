                <li>Blanch the potatoes and green beans in boiling water for 2 minutes. Drain under cold running water and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a pestle and mortar, crush the garlic with half a teaspoon sea salt until you have a smooth paste. Add the basil leaves and pound until the leaves turn to a pulp. Add the pine nuts and crush until smooth. Add 3 tablespoons of water to emulsify the mixture, then add the Parmesan cheese. Slowly work in the olive oil, until you have a drizzling consistency.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of boiling salted water to the boil, add cook the pasta with the blanched potatoes and green beans for about 3 minutes - the pasta should still have a bite.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, warm half of the pesto in a frying pan.</li>
                <li>Using tongs, lift the pasta, green beans and potatoes from the water and add to the frying pan. Toss with the pesto and add 2-3 tablespoons of the pasta water to loosen the sauce so it coats the pasta strands.</li>
                <li>Check the seasoning and divide the pasta between two bowls. Serve with the remaining pesto spooned over the top.</li>
